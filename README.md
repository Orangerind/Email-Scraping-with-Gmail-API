# Email Scraping with Gmail API
 This project entails authenticating and creating a Gmail service using the API. The client requested to read from a personal email account and extract specific information from emails sent by a certain email address which contains specific words on the subject line. The extracted details on matched emails, including Tenant, Email Address, Phone Number, Number of Travelers, and Dates, were stored in a pandas dataframe and exported into an Excel file.
